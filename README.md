Blocks any pull request which will not result in a [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to the base branch when merged with a [squash and merge](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) strategy using GitHub's default commit message.

Its rules are simple:

- For a branch containing multiple commits, the PR must have a conventional title.

- For a branch containing only a single commit...
  - ... the commit itself must have a conventional commit message, and...
  - ... for consistency, the PR title must match that message.
